# Project 2 Data Pagination and Filtering
 Data Pagination and Filtering


This project created a directory with 9 students per page. 

The following functions provided a working directory:

1. showPage function displayed the first page with 9 students. A template literal was created to display the following information: profile photo, first and last name, email, and registration date. 

2. addPagination function calculated the amount of pages needed per the student array. A for loop was created to iterate a template literal for the button. Within this function, an event listener was called to move from page to page.
